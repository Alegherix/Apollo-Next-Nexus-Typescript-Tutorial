Used for learning to setup an API route with Next.js that serves an ApolloServer with a schema built with Nexus. And then to create an ApolloClient to talk to that ApolloServer either via a HTTP request or via a SchemaLink which basically evaluates to populating an In Memory Cache from the getStaticProps method which is then sent as a prop and used in the client.
